TODOS:
reset router to current settings and edit routers web port so i can forward port 80 and still access the router

update all book/audiobook metadata (it all got removed somehow. back this shit up julia!!)

make startup script (see below) and add it to initrc or whatever alpines equivalent is

make caddyfile

automatic file detection and running of mkv script? if i do this i need to account for removal of truehd audio cause ffmpeg hates that shit.

add git commit cmd to backup script and add to cronjob (or make a c driver script and add it to init since cron is fucky on alpine). instead add script to mount copy and umount? dont like the idea of having the backup drive constantly plugged in but its not a bad idea, as most issues will be software not my house burning down. plus i can store an extra copy on offsite cloud storage. longterm todo is to have that be automagic.

add aliases for df -h, du -h, ls -l and such. maybe remove-subs script too

NOTES:
on startup:
mount sda to hdd0 sdc to hdd1 and sdd to hdd2, hdd3 is sde but only should be mounted when i run the backup script (see relevant TODO above)
startup reverse proxy
start jellyfin

$ cat list.txt
file '/full/path/to/file/1'
file '/full/path/to/file/2'

$ ffmpeg -f concat -safe 0 -i list.txt -c copy out.ogg

got rid of the ddns scripts since my wan ip only changes on router reboot (pretty much never), and if i use a dynamic record i cant serve over https since an ssl certificate cant be issued without an apex a record, which cant be done with a dynamic record.
